# File_Sorting_homework
A python program that sorts a Sort Me.txt file. I used Anaconda3 Spyder to make this program and recommend Anaconda3 Spyder to be used to run this. 

Any other compiler for python should work. 

For batch testing I would go to the folder that its in and type in the folder address cmd for the command promt. After the command promt is open at the files locate type in the command promt 'Run_Script.bat'. press enter and it should run the test. If it doesn't run at all then the batch location is off, or you need to setup search path for python.exe here a link to do that: https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm. As for the batch file loction it needs to be with the py files in the same folder.
