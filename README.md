# File_Sorting_homework
A python program that sorts a Sort Me.txt file. I used Anaconda3 Spyder to make this program and recommend Anaconda3 Spyder to be used to run this. 

Any other compiler for python should work. 

Next I was instructed to reverse the sorting order, so that I can make a pull request to the changes that I made. Then merge to into the mian branch.
