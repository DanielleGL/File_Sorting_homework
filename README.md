# File_Sorting_homework
A python program that sorts a Sort Me.txt file. I used Anaconda3 Spyder to make this program and recommend Anaconda3 Spyder to be used to run this. 

Any other compiler for python should work. 

For batch testing I would go to the folder that its in and type in the folder address cmd for the command promt. After the command promt is open at the files locate type in the command promt 'Run_Script.bat'. press enter and it should run the test. If it doesn't run at all then the file locations are off. To fix this use need to the batch file path, the first path needs to go to your python.exe and the other two the py file it should look like this:

My Path:
"C:\Users\liana\anaconda3\python.exe" "C:\Users\liana\OneDrive\Desktop\CSC 499\For Homework Two\DanielleGallardoAssignmentTwo.py"

Example:

"path to python.exe" "Path to py file app"
